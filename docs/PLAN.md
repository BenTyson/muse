## Critical Path Items

### Must Complete Before Moving to Next Phase:
1. **Phase 1 → 2**: Database schema and authentication working
2. **Phase 2 → 3**: Booking system creating sessions correctly
3. **Phase 3 → 4**: Payment processing working with webhooks
4. **Phase 4 → 5**: Photo upload and gallery access functional
5. **Phase 5 → 6**: Orders being created and submitted to POD
6. **Phase 6 → 7**: Admin workflow complete for session management

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- **UI Components**: Can be built alongside backend features
- **Email Templates**: Can be developed during any phase
- **Content/Copy**: Can be written while coding features
- **Testing**: Unit tests can be added as features are completed

## MVP Definition

- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Package selection and session booking
- [ ] Basic payment processing (one-time payments)
- [ ] Photo gallery with access control
- [ ] Basic product ordering
- [ ] Admin session management
- [ ] Order fulfillment to POD provider

### Enhanced Features (Nice to Have):

## Testing Checkpoints

### End of Each Phase Testing:
1. **Phase 1**: Can create account, login, view packages
2. **Phase 2**: Can complete full booking flow
3. **Phase 3**: Can process payment and receive confirmation
4. **Phase 4**: Can access gallery and view photos
5. **Phase 5**: Can order products and receive confirmation
6. **Phase 6**: Admin can manage sessions and orders
7. **Phase 7**: All user flows work perfectly under load

### Critical User Journeys to Test:
1. **New Customer**: Register → Book session → Pay → Access gallery → Order products
2. **Returning Customer**: Login → View previous sessions → Access gallery → Reorder
3. **Admin Workflow**: Upload photos → Create gallery → Manage orders → Process fulfillment
4. **Payment Failure Recovery**: Failed payment → Retry → Success → Order processing

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment:
- Local PostgreSQL database
- Stripe test keys
- AWS S3 test bucket
- Local email debugging (console output)

### Production Environment:
- Production PostgreSQL with backups
- Stripe live keys with webhooks
- Production S3 bucket with CloudFront
- SendGrid for email delivery
- Sentry for error monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
